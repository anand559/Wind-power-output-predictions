#  Wind Power Output predictions

Wind power forecasting Data Excel file containing wind power and weather forecast data.
              
The columns contain the following: 

              TIMESTAMP: Self-explanatory. 
              TARGETVAR: Hourly-mean wind power normalised by the maximum output of the wind farm. 
              U10: Forecast zonal wind velocity (m/s) at 10m above ground. 
              V10: Forecast meridional wind velocity (m/s) at 10m above ground. 
              U100: Forecast zonal wind velocity (m/s) at 100m above ground. 
              V100: Forecast meridional wind velocity (m/s) at 100m above ground.   
  
  
  Wind power data are missing from the final day of the dataset. The task is to predict the wind power output 
  for this day based on the available weather forecasts.
